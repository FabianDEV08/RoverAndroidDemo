# Rover Android Coding Project

The goal of this project to create an Android app that persistently stores and displays a collection of dogs and related data.

You can use any external frameworks you'd like to complete this project, however, modern Android SDKs and tools should be used. That said, feel free to write your sample in either Kotlin or Java.

The work you create here should be representative of code that we'd expect to receive from you if you were hired tomorrow. Our expectation is that you'll write production quality code including tests.

Update the existing README to help us understand your approach and thought process, e.g. design choices, trade-offs, dependencies, etc.

There is no time limit, although we don't want to take too much of your time, so we advise people to not spend more than 8 hours on the project.

Finally, this is not a trick project, so if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.


### Requirements

1. A user should be able to create a dog with the dog's name and a photo of the dog.

2. The newly created dog should display in a list of all dogs.

3. Each dog in the list should show its name and a thumbnail photo.

4. When a dog is selected, display a view that shows:
  - The dog's name
  - A larger version of the dog's photo

5. Minimum API target should be 19, but UI should follow basic Material patterns.


Complete this project and push your solution back to this repository.
When you're finished, please email your Rover contact and let them know.

Be aware that we will have you use and modify this project for the in-person portion of the interview.
